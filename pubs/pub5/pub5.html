                            <h4><b>Researches about theory (R)</b></h4>
                            <h5>
                                <b>4_R) A characteristic or attribute or property of the units of observation can be
                                    measured and operationalized on different "levels", on a given unit of observation,
                                    giving rise to possible different operative variables. Find out about the proposed
                                    classifications of variables and express your opinion about their respective
                                    usefulness.</b>
                            </h5>
                            <p>We know when we have to deal with entities we can describe a lot of characteristics of them. For example, when I describe a girl I can speak about her eyes (brown or green, little or big..), her body (tall, skinny, 165cm, 5.1
                                inches...) or her behaviour. All of these properties can be classified into categories. The best-known classification was published by the Psychologist Stanley Smith Stevens. I drop here a chart taken from a video on Youtube
                                <a href="#link1">[1]</a> that explains in a very clear way this categorization.
                                <div class="container"> <img src="levels.png" alt="levels"> </div><br> We can measure data distingushing from the <b>quantitative</b> data and <b>qualitative</b> data. The first refer only to numeric data (so something that I can quantify), the
                                second instead refer to the data I can describe with words/adjectives or numbers (but they don't have to be a measure of anything). But, be careful, I can describe the same entity using both types of variables, for example
                                as we saw before, I can describe the body of a girl as tall (using a scale of short, medium and tall; so qualitative data) or saying she's 165 centimeters (using quantitative data).
                                <br> Let's focus on Qualitative data. They can be split into another two categories:
                                <b>Nominal</b> and
                                <b>Ordinal</b>. Both use words to describe some data; an example of nominal measurement is using the seasons name: so winter, fall, spring and summer, so for instance I can group the days of the year classifying them with
                                the season they are in. The ordinal measurement differs from the nominal because I can sort the informations and I have a kind of range of measurement. So for example I can classify some dishes in a restaurant using a scale
                                of
                                <i>disgusting, acceptable, good, delicious</i>. Of course we can see here a scale, a range, a lower grade and upper grade.<br> Instead talking about Quantitative measurement, there is a little difference between them. Both
                                use numeric values to describe a property, but <b>Interval</b> doesn't have necessarily the Zero value as the lower value. A good example for the nominal level is the temperature measured in C or F. The zero is just a value
                                and it isn't the lower bound. Instead the temperature measured in K has a true Zero value (so is the actual lower bound) and it is a <b>ratio</b> level of measurement.
                                <h1><b>usefulness</b></h1>
                            </p>
                            <h5>
                                <b>5_R) Describe the most common configuration of data repository in the real world

                                    conceptual picture of how all these elements works together and how the flow of

                                    data.</b>
                            </h5>
                            <p>The <b>Online transaction processing</b> (OLTP) systems facilitate the transactions processes. We can define two meanings of the term transaction <a href="#link2">[2]</a>:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Transaction in Database Management System means the atomic process to apply changes to data.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Transaction in Financial world means the actual process to move money from a source to a target.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                This type of systems are specifically advanced to process insert and update processes. One example of these is the ATM where you can send/receive money. Obviously the requisites for these systems are availability, speed and high concurrency performance.
                                The OLTP system design requires:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Rollback segments: These are the portions of DBMS who record the actions of transactions and provide the ability to go back and
                                    restore the system to its previous state.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Clusters: These are groups of tables in a DBMS and they help the systems to make the JOIN operations faster.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Discrete transactions: This technology make the changes atomic and defers all the changes until the transaction is committed.
                                        So, it stores changes in a different environment and apply the changes when the transaction is confirmed.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Block size: The block size of these systems must be a multiple of the OS where the system is hosted to avoid multiple unnecessary and 
                                        low-performance input/output actions.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Buffer cache size: These types of systems have to maximize the use of caching technology due to high level of concurrent requests.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                This type of system is constrasted to <b>Online Analytical Processing</b> (OLAP) because these systems process much more complex queries
                                but in a smaller volume. OLTP uses all of the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete) instead OLAP systems typically uses
                                read only.
                                Typical applications of OLAP include business reporting for sales, marketing, management reporting, business process management (BPM),
                                budgeting and forecasting, financial reporting and similar areas, with new applications emerging, such as agriculture <a href="#link3">[3]</a>.
                                There are three main types of OLAP systems:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Multidimensional OLAP (MOLAP): MOLAP (multi-dimensional online analytical processing) is the classic form of OLAP and is 
                                        sometimes referred to as just OLAP. MOLAP stores this data in an optimized multi-dimensional array storage, rather than in a relational database.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Relational OLAP (ROLAP): ROLAP works directly with relational databases and does not require pre-computation. The base data 
                                        and the dimension tables are stored as relational tables and new tables are created to hold the aggregated information.

                                        Hybrid OLAP (HOLAP): HOLAP database will use relational tables to hold the larger quantities of detailed data,
                                        and use specialized storage for at least some aspects of the smaller quantities of more-aggregate or less-detailed data.
                                        HOLAP addresses the shortcomings of MOLAP and ROLAP by combining the capabilities of both approaches.

                                A <b>Data Warehouse</b> (DW) is a centralized repository of data that can be analyzed to make
                                more informed decisions. DBMS and other systems send informations to data warehouses usually on a regular basis.
                                Business analysts, data engineers, data scientists access data to take decisions and study the flow of the information.

                                The data and the related analysis have become critical factors to ensure the competitiveness of corporates.
                                Reports, dashboards and analytics tools are indispensable for extracting insights from data, monitoring
                                business performance and supporting decision making.

                                A data warehouse maintains a copy of information from the source transaction systems. This architectural complexity provides the opportunity to:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Integrate data from multiple sources into a single database and data model. More congregation of data to single database so a single query engine can be used to present data in an ODS.</li>
                                    <li>Mitigate the problem of database isolation level lock contention in transaction processing systems caused by attempts to run large, long-running analysis queries in transaction processing databases.</li>
                                    <li>Maintain data history, even if the source transaction systems do not.</li>
                                    <li>Integrate data from multiple source systems, enabling a central view across the enterprise. This benefit is always valuable, but particularly so when the organization has grown by merger.</li>
                                    <li>Improve data quality, by providing consistent codes and descriptions, flagging or even fixing bad data.</li>
                                    <li>Make decision–support queries easier to write.</li>
                                    <li>Organize and disambiguate repetitive data.</li>

                                What is the arithmetic mean?<br>
                                In mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean, or simply the mean or the average (when the context is clear),
                                is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection.
                                The collection is often a set of results of an experiment or an observational study,
                                or frequently a set of results from a survey.<a href="#link5">[5]</a><br>
                                The naive algorithm, so the first coming in mind is ,obviously, to sum all the values and then divide by the number of the items.

                            To calculate the arithmetic mean, I have to sum all the ages and then divide by 10.
                            So: 390/10 = 39. We know now the arithmetic mean of this set of values is 39.<br>
                            We calculated this number without difficulty, but can we have some obstacles in some weird circumstances?<br>
                            <b>Yes</b>. First of all, as we have seen in the previous section, we could have an infinite set of values.
                            So, for example, we could have to collect data every n milliseconds (timeseries data, for instance financial/geosismic data)
                            and it's pratically impossible to start this type of algorithm because we never will have a finite set of values.<br>
                            Second, computers have limited resources and it's not so difficult to overload them.
